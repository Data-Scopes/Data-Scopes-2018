# Week 2, Day 3: Wednesday, July 19
## Synopsis

Week 2, Day 3 expands upon the idea of digital editions as text processing pipelines. After a short recap of day 2, we continue with the step normalization. We will show how these two pipeline stages prepare texts for automated collation. The process of automated collation is also discussed from a modeling perspective (GM). Participants learn that their research goals and questions influence the computational pipelines.

## Outcome goals
* Understanding the principles of basic text transformations like normalization and how they serve different objectives
* Bringing together tokenization and normalization as individual pipeline steps and seeing how they can be implemented in the act of collation Normalize, tokenize, and collate text
* Fundamentals of TAG: hypergraph Modeling discontinuity
## Legend

* **Presentation:** by instructors
* **Discussion:** instructors and participants
* **Talk lab:** participants discuss or plan in small groups
* **Code lab:** participants code alone or in small groups

We’ll end each day with a request for feedback, based on a general version of the day’s outcome goals, and we’ll try to adapt on the fly to your responses. Please complete [Week 2, Day 3 feedback](week_2_day_3_feedback.md) (just copy and paste it into a plain-text document) and email your response to Kaylen at [kaylensanders@pitt.edu](mailto:kaylensanders@pitt.edu) with the subject heading “Week 2, Day 3 feedback”.
